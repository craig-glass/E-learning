## Usage

### Student view

Registered Courses:

Students can view module content, watch lectures, submit assignments, and take
quizzes. It is also possible for students to keep track of their progress
through the analytics section in the user profile area. The announcements page
will hold notifications set by a member of staff for a given course for
students to view.

### Staff view

Staff can create/modify announcements, content, lectures, assignments, and
quizzes. Members of staff also have permissions to view and edit student
details, either through the user's settings page or through the admin, as well
as being able to view any students analytics.

### Admin view

Admins (superusers) can modify contents of the database directly through the
admin view under the url (/admin). Staff also have limited access to this view.
